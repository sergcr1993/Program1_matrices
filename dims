#The pupose of this program is to
#write bash shell scripts to compute
#matrix operations. The program performs
#the following operations:
#dims, transpose, mean, add, and multiply

# Temporary files
tempFile="tempfile$$"

#Deteles temporary files
deleteTempFiles() {
	rm -f *$$
}

# This function prints out the
# dimensions of the matrix passed in.
# It is rows by columns.
function dims(){ 

	#Initialize rows 
	row=0

	#Looping through each line of matrix
	while read myLine
	do

		#Initialize columns 
		column=0

		#Looping through each element by
		#evaluating the expression
		for i in $myLine
		do
			column=`expr $column + 1`
		done	
		row=`expr $row + 1`
	done < $1

	echo "$row $column"

}


#The following instructions validate commands
#that input by the user. The first step in the hierarchy
#checks to see how many arguments are passed on using
#comparison operators.
